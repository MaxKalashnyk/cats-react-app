# cats-react-app - my first React app

[Demo](https://kalash14.github.io/cats-react-app/)  |  [Code](https://github.com/kalash14/cats-react-app/tree/master/src) 

This is my first React app based on the first finished homework from [Kottans](https://github.com/kottans/) frontend [course](https://github.com/Kottans/frontend).
I finished this task in Vanilla JS in that course, but after start learning React I'd like to rewrite my code in React.
After finishing this task I love even more React, because using this library it's really useful, powerful and simple in use.
I'm very inspired this library and continue to learn React!
