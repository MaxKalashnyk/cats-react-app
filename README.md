# Cats house - my first React application

[Demo](https://MaxKalashnyk.github.io/cats-react-app/)  |  [Code](https://github.com/kalash14/cats-react-app/tree/master/src) 

This is my first React app based on the first finished homework from [Kottans](https://github.com/kottans/) frontend [course](https://github.com/Kottans/frontend).

I finished this task in Vanilla JS in the Cottans course, but after start learning React I'd like to rewrite my code using this library.

I consolidated my skills in JSX basics and using React props and state here.

After finishing this task I love even more React, because it's really fast, powerful and simple in use.
I'm very inspired this library and continue to learn it!
